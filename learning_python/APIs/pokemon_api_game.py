# Task:
# API documentation: Pok√©API (pokeapi.co)
# Recommended: Understand the Pokemon lookup program first (code below) to fully understand accessing data from the API.
# The Pok√©mon data MUST come from the PokeApi
# Get random Pok√©mon for at least the CPU (Player can be chosen or random)
# Pok√©mon should fight and a winner should be declared in some way
# No Pygame. Focus on interacting with the API.
# Be as creative as you like after this. Can you incorporate different abilities/stats etc.?
# Try and work collaboratively on the one repo using Git
# To deliver: Give it your best shot! Share your code (message your Ramon + Luke directly, NOT a message in the main chat) by COB (17:00)

# Comments explaining the code:
# LIFE constant: This sets the initial life points for each Pok√©mon.
# API request: The program requests a list of Pok√©mon from the Pok√©API and prints them with their IDs.
# init_pokemon() function: This initializes a Pok√©mon by fetching its data from the API, formatting its height and weight, and assigning four random moves.
# print_life() function: Prints the current life of both players in each round.
# Gameplay loop: The main battle loop allows each player (user and CPU) to take turns attacking. The user selects an attack, while the CPU selects a random attack. The loop continues until one Pok√©mon's life reaches 0.
# Winning condition: If a player's attack reduces the opponent's life to 0 or below, the game declares a winner and ends.
# This code meets the requirements for the project by using data from the Pok√©API, simulating a battle, and allowing players to attack in turns.
