## Fizz Buzz

### Summary 
* Print `incremented numbers` to the screen but substitute `multiples of 3 with 'Fizz'`,` multiples of 5 with 'Buzz'`, and `multiples of both with 'FizzBuzz'` 

### Rationale
* Great to consolidate control flow topic. 

### The task 

Core:
* Make a new 'fizzbuzz.py' file 
* Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
* For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number 
* For the multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of the number 
* For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz". 

### If time: 
* Improve the script so we can decide which numbers to substitute for "Fizz" and "Buzz" 
* Refactor using functions 

### Acceptance Criteria
* All core task are done 
* Core works with no error
