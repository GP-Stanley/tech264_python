"""# Rationale: To practice lists
Script should act like a waiter at a restaurant taking orders

level 1
- Greet the user
- Print a list of starters
- Take an input for the user for their starter
- Print a list of mains
- Take an input for the user for their main course
- Print a list of desserts
- Take an input for the user for their dessert
- Print all of the user's choices

level 2
- Use at least one f-string
- Add each item ordered to a list called 'customer_order_list'

level 3 (may need research if we have not covered dictionaries yet)
- Use dictionaries and assign prices to the items. Create a bill at the end of the program.

level 4
- Add more to this program. Recommended ways are: Only allow input that is within the list, Add quantities of order etc.
