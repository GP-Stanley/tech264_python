* Explain and demonstrate: Numeric data types: int and float
* Explain and demonstrate: Boolean data type
* Explain why the result is not 0.9999999... with this code and what lesson we should learn:

### Floating-Point Number
A float is a number that has a decimal point.
It can also be positive, negative, or zero.

```python
x = 10.5
y = -5.75
z = 0.0

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

### Boolean Data Type
* A Boolean data type can only have two values: True or False.
* It is used to represent the truth values of logic and Boolean algebra.
* False = 'empty', True has value.
