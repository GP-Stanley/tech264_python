Task: Learn Git - Stage 1

Check you have git on your machine git --version

Create your first Git repo named 'tech264-test-git'

> 1. Create 'tech264-test-git' folder as usual.
> 2. Open a terminal and change directories to point to the folder,
> 3. Run the command to initiate a git repo git init

Create a README.md file via the IDE

Do your first commit
> 1. Run git status to confirm the added file is in a modified stage.
> 2. Stage the file by running git add . (adding the . stages all unstaged files).
> 3. Make commit and associate it with a message git commit -m "My first commit"
> 4. Run git status to confirm repo state.

Make changes to README.md file and do another commit.

Â· Edit file and follow 'Do your first commit' steps.

Check differences between commits

> 1. Run git log to display the logging info for both commits.
> 2. Find the hash id associated with each commit log.
> 3. Run git diff <hash-id1> <hash-id2>
> 4. Alternatively, to check the difference between the most recent and previous commit run git diff HEAD^ HEAD

Use git checkout to point to the previous commit and then back to the most recent commit.

> 1. Find each commits id.
> 2. To point to another commit run git checkout <hash-id> (run the command for both commits)
Restore a specific file to its state in a previous commit

> 1. Find the commit id of the state where the file should be restored to.
> 2. Run git checkout <hash-id> -- <file-name>
> 3. Note: The file now should be at a staged state, commit the file!

`HEAD` : A reference to the very last commit you made in that branch.
If you create a new commit, the HEAD will move.

How to reference `previous HEAD` (commit):

* git checkout HEAD~1 --"file name you want to restore"

`Detached HEAD` status:
* after get status, it means the head is pointing towards a specific commit rather than the branch.
* git checkout HEAD~1 <file name>

How to `attach HEAD`:
1. git checkout master
2. git log : this shows the history.
3. git status : this shows where you are currently.
